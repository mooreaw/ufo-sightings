## README

Code and data building the graphics and analysis for this [post](https://semidocumentedlife.com/post/exploring-nuforc-sightings/) on my personal page. I used data from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings) representing UFO sightings across the US, and analyzed it on a geographic basis as well as from a more standard regression approach. This was a toy project, but it helped teach me how to use two really awesome packages ([tidycensus](https://github.com/walkerke/tidycensus), and [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)).

The code on my personal page is written as an RMarkdown report, but I've stripped out the code to present it here. Additionally I demo'd some of the code used to build the choropleth map for the Ann Arbor R User Group-- you can look at the slides [here.](https://cdn.rawgit.com/mooreaw/ufo-sightings/master/explore-ufo-pres.html)
