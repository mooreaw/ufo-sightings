When my dad took me to the library as a kid, I used to love hanging out in the UFOlogy section, reading about classified military aircraft and stories of close encounters. I'm less convinced now that hooting tentacle monsters will be landing in our backyards anytime soon, but I was super excited to see that Kaggle had posted a dataset compiling UFO sightings across the US.

<!-- https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings -->
<!-- https://github.com/planetsig/ufo-reports -->

The data comes from individually reported sightings, archived by [NUFORC](http://www.nuforc.org/). I retrieved the data from Kaggle.com, and the dirty-work as far as data-cleaning/prep was done by [`@planetsig`](https://github.com/planetsig/ufo-reports). Over 80,000 events are recorded, going all the way back to the early 1900s. In addition to listing the date/time that a sighting was reported, the shape of the object, city, state, country, and lat/lon coordinates are all recorded. Most of the reports are from the US (`r percent(nrow(us) / nrow(scrubbed))`), so I decided to keep my focus there.

### How have UFO sightings changed over time?

One of my first questions had one of the most unexpected answers, at least for me. Looping back to my grade-school reading habits, I was looking at books written in the 80s and 90s, and most of the highlighted and exciting accounts were from the 60s and 70s, during the cold war. [Project Blue Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Blue_Book) was set up by the US Airforce in the 50s, and aimed to collect evidence and explain different sightings that were occurring during that time. It was ultimately shut down by discontinued funding and inconclusive findings, but I expected to see higher reported sightings during this period. NUFORC was started in 1974, so it's possible the archiving of events prior to then hasn't been pursued as closely. Overall, since about 2000 the number of sightings for your average state in the US has seen a steady climb. My thinking is that more people are on the lookout for UFOs these days, but there's probably a fair amount of underreporting. Given the prominence of search engines, the likelihood of someone being able to look up and report a sighting to NUFORC has maybe gotten higher.

So, what kind of stuff are people seeing? Across the whole time span, the most common kind of UFO are lights-- maybe looking something like [this](https://youtu.be/qxLEnqsUYS4) (a sighting from 2016 in North Carolina), followed by triangles or circles. However, this trend seems to pick up mostly in the 2000s. Earlier sightings were much more likely to report the classic saucer/disk shape. As far as explanations for UFOs go, the most straightfoward is that a sighting isn't unusual at all, where people mistakenly identify normal aircraft for something else. Part of me has to feel like this increase in the share of sightings of "lights" has to reflect this.

us %$% hour(date_time) %>% median(na.rm = TRUE)

```

Next I wanted to know whether there's a particular "season" for spotting UFOs. To get there, I created a rate of sightings per million people in the US population. This is a point where we can get a grip on just how rare sightings are, per-person-- in 2013 we're only seeing 2.4~ sightings per million people. You can see things getting busier the closer we get to the present, but there are also defined portions of the year that people are most likely to report sightings-- namely during the summer and fall, when people tend to be outside. Regardless of the time of year, most sightings occur at night, between 7pm and 12am. An article from the Economist a few years ago [notes](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21605918-everything-you-need-know-about-ufos-0) that this lines up with when people tend to be drinking. The monthly trends might agree with this, given that sightings are strongest during summers and fall, when the weather is most likely to be good.

```{r usa-yr-month, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=10, fig.align="center"}
# dataset from tidyr
data(population)

uspop <- filter(population, country == "United States of America")

p2 <- us %>%
  count(mo = month(date_time), year_sighted) %>%
  inner_join(uspop, by = c("year_sighted" = "year")) %>%
  mutate(
    Rate = n %>% divide_by(population) %>% multiply_by(1000000),
    Month = factor(mo, levels = 1:12, labels = month.name),
    Year  = factor(year_sighted)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x    = Year,
    y    = Month,
    fill = Rate
  )) +
  geom_tile() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "white", high = "blue") +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
  labs(x = "", y = "", title = "UFO Sightings in the USA per 1,000,000 People")

### What's the deal with Vermont?

We've gone through the what/when as far as UFO sightings in the US. Now we'll dig down even a bit to see how the rate we used above varies by state. 2013 is the last complete year of data, so I linked ACS estimates to the total number of encounters in 2013 across each state, and put it together as a choropleth below. Vermont definitely has the most sightings per capita (Maine and the Pacific northwest aren't doing too bad either), whereas Texas and the south seem to have the least.

```{r map, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=10, include = FALSE}
state_rates <- us %>%
  filter(year_sighted == 2010) %>%
  count(state) %>%
  left_join(pops, by = c("state" = "abb")) %>%
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
  mutate(
    Rate  = n %>% divide_by(estimate) %>% multiply_by(1000000) %>% round(2),
    state = tolower(names)
  )

state_rates <- left_join(
  state_rates,
  pops %>%
    select(names, abb) %>%
    distinct %>%
    mutate(abb = toupper(abb))
)

# crosswalk
state_xover <- data_frame(
  region = tolower(state.name),
  state  = tolower(state.abb)
)

state_rates <- us %>%
  filter(year_sighted == 2013) %>%
  count(state) %>%
  left_join(state_xover, by = "state") %>%
  left_join(
    read_csv("census-us-state-populations-2013.csv") %>%
      rename(region = state) %>%
      mutate(region = tolower(region) %>% gsub("^\\s+|\\s+$", "", .)),
    by = "region"
  ) %>%
  mutate(Rate = n %>% divide_by(pop13) %>% multiply_by(1000000) %>% round(2)) %>%
  mutate(abb = toupper(state))

states_map <- map_data("state")
```

```{r map2, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=10}
# specify some map projection/options
g <- list(
  scope = 'usa',
  projection = list(type = 'albers usa'),
  lakecolor = toRGB('white')
)

choro <-
  plot_ly(
    z            = state_rates$Rate,
    # text         = state_rates$names,
    locations    = state_rates$abb,
    type         = "choropleth",
    locationmode = "USA-states"
  ) %>%
  colorbar(title = "Per Million People") %>%
  layout(
    title = "UFO Sightings by State, US 2013<br>(Hover for exact value)",
    geo   = g
  )

```

In the Economist article I mentioned earlier, they suggest that sightings tend to spurn big cities, rationale being that light pollution drives down reports.

Here's a look at a handful of states whose geography I'm relatively familiar with (as with the map above, reports are from 2013; click on the markers if you want to read a description of the sightings).

```{r just-seattle, eval = TRUE}
wa1213 <- filter(us, state %in% c("wa", "or"), year_sighted %in% 2013)

m <- leaflet(data = wa1213) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
  addMarkers(
    ~longitude,
    ~latitude,
    popup = ~as.character(comments),
    label = ~as.character(date_posted)
  )

m  # Print the map
```

I'm not sure if I'm totally on board with the Economist's conclusions... Let's focus on Washington; most of the sightings tend to follow the the Puget Sound and the suburban towns surrounding Seattle. These areas are fairly dense, population-wise. They're maybe far enough away to get out from under the light pollution of cities, but there's probably a good mix of people walking/driving around. The region around/including Portland also seems to break the mold. There aren't a ton of sightings that are right in the middle of cities, but I'm not sure if they're truly *remote* (I could be wrong-- locals should correct me on this). It feels like we're looking at a phenomena driven primarily by population size, rather than rurality.

### Are there cultural or population-based factors that are related to sightings?

We're seeing some regional differences in the number of sightings, but are there features of state populations that seem to be implicated in the number of sightings? There are a number of potential characteristics that could be used to summarize a state based on its population and culture-- many of which are collected by the census. For starters, I pulled in proportions of race/ethnicity, each state's median age, median cost of rent, per capita income, and its total population size.

Aside from demographic and economic summaries, I also wanted to touch on some cultural and psychological factors that might be implicated in a state's count of paranormal sightings. Using data provided by over 1.5 million people across 5 samples, Rentfrow et al. [(2013)](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-a0034434.pdf) measured [big-5 personality traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits), intending to organize regions of the US based on personality profiles. One of their findings was that western states tended to have higher levels of *Openness*, and lower levels of *Neuroticism*. Rentfrow et al. provided the averages from each state in one of their tables, which we'll be able to use here. The samples were mostly self-selected and tended to skew young and predominantly white, but it's the only accessible data of its kind that I'm aware of. Lastly, I pulled in some survey data on religiosity gathered by Gallup (sourced [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_religiosity)); the measure is simply the proportion of respondents who indicated that religion is somewhat or very important to them. Fairly rudimentary, but the timeframe lines up.

After pulling in the state-level data, I summed the total number of sightings for each state in 2013, and then fit the data with a Poisson regression model (the proper type when you're trying to model data that come from distributions like the one we have below). I also converted some of the variables into Z-scores. Regression analyses help quantify how a dependent variable (# of sightings) responds as independent variables (such as a state's population size) increase or decrease. Our variables for housing prices, population size, and income are on the scales of thousands or millions. I think it's a bit easier to think about changes in these quantities as distances from the country's average, rather than trying to look at how sightings vary by adding/subtracting one person or dollar at a time.

Okay, last piece of data, I promise! Here we have a table with our estimates from the model. What we're looking at are Incident Rate Ratios (IRR), which reflect the amount our expected count is *multiplied* when an independent variable increases by one unit. So, in the case of our most influential variable, a state with per-capita consumption of alcohol between 2.1-2.31 should have almost 5 times the number of sightings compared to states that consume >2.31 gallons/per-capita. The confidence intervals give us a sense of where that estimate should lie over the long-run if we were to repeat our the analysis with new data.

Most of our variables don't seem to be strongly related to a state's sightings. A quick rule of thumb is to check if the confidence interval contains 1.0-- if it does, it's not clear whether the relationship is statistically meaningful. The top-3 variables in our model appear to be alcohol consumption, population size, and rent seem worth commenting on; the rest... maybe not so much.

```{r model-results}
library(knitr)

sightings_est %>%
  mutate(conf = str_c("  (", lower, " - ", upper, ")")) %>%
  select(term, irr, conf) %>%
  filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Term", "IRR", "    95% CI"), align = c("l", "r", "r"))
```

First off, we have something kind of strange going on with our alcohol consumption variable. States that consume >2.31 gallons/person are our reference group in this analysis, meaning that each category's impact is compared against the reference. 30 states fall into this group (including California, Idaho, Vermont, and Oregon just to name a few). What this suggests is that states that are in the low to mid range of alcohol consumption tend to see more sightings. The precision of the estimate isn't great (as indicated by how wide the confidence interval is), but the main takeaway is that states that have medium levels of alcohol consumption (such as Ohio, Virginia, or Indiana) see more sightings when holding the other variables constant. As I mentioned previously, it seems like a reasonable hunch that alcohol might be implicated in the frequency of sightings, but what this tells us is that there's might be a sweet-spot as far as the groups/populations that are spotting things. It doesn't appear to be as simple as "more beer --> more UFO sightings", at least.

At the end of the day, it's probably not surprising that our cultural variables only hold weak relationships with the # of sightings. The personality scores I've pulled from Rentfrow et al.'s paper are really coarse measures of what I'd actually be interested in looking at (and, even if we were seeing a pattern, it'd be hard to think it's anything but noise). We're attempting to understand a rare and fairly weird phenomenon, zoomed really far out from the people actually reporting these things. Ideally, we'd be able to look at a whole database of survey data and see if it included questions asking whether participants had ever thought they'd seen a UFO. Openness, as studied and discussed by academic researchers, has been shown to be related to a number of behaviors and preferences. Some of the more stable and replicable findings are the trait's positive relationships with political liberalism and educational attainment. There's also some evidence showing its association with higher subjective well-being, imagination, and creativity.

I'm really not sure what people are seeing most of these nights; a fairly high proportion of sightings can be attributed to weather and astrological phenomena (NUFORC's own notes on each sighting often mention or cross-reference this kind of information). But, I feel like there's something indelibly optimistic, or at least characteristically human for people's willingness to look upwards and question what they know. Naivety and ignorance aren't virtues we usually celebrate, but there's a certain innocence that surrounds reports like these. Thinking back to the books I used to read in my city library, the reports I'd read from people who'd claimed to see things usually didn't have elaborate conspiracies attached to them. They were usually just confused about what they'd seen, even willing to doubt themselves when presented with evidence to the contrary. It feels like a fair amount of our energy is spent being suspicious of others and the motives behind their beliefs, but I find myself feeling like there's something harmless in sharing these stories. Even if we're just accidentally tracking wayward satellites, these are moments where people are genuinely thinking outside of themselves and the rigid and predictable paths of life on our planet. Maybe that leads to a deeper question: how should we be treating each other and our home, if we knew someone else was watching us, or if we knew our potential wasn't being met?
